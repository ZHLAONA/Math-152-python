In order to find the number of steps in the Collatz sequence until a smaller integer is found, we first assign two new variables, steps and input_num. Each time the looped part of the code is executed once, the number of steps is increased by 1. We use input_num to keep track of the initial n value, in case the n is assigned a new value after the loop. When the n is less than input_num, which is the initial n value, we stop the loop and return the number of steps. The number of steps at this point is the number of steps in the Collatz sequence until a smaller integer is found.And we call this the dropping time. For example dropping time of 3 is 6."

        "As I found that every negative odd integer always has a dropping time of 1. Above I run a test to see the dropping time of negative numbers in the range of (-100,-2) and it exceed the limit of compiling time. If I change the n < input_num to n > input_num and will get partial result and I can see it is still unordered. We can it the output above, it stops at -17 for a really long time and did not get a dropping time for that. what we found now is input numebr as -17 will turn into a long-time loop that colab will exceed the compiling time."
